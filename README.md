Bitcoin's substantial price volatility and expanding market capitalization demand more investigation. This study uses exploratory research to see if there are any correlations between various variables in a cryptocurrency dataset and whether they may help us understand why Bitcoin prices are so volatile. Following that, using inferential techniques, the study tries to address the research question "the feasibility of a quantitative analysis model and a machine learning model in predicting the price of Bitcoin."
To determine whether or not the data is stationary, an enhanced Dickey-Fuller test was carried out and performed. On the training dataset that had been cleaned and scaled, we implemented and compared the performances of the SARIMAX and Random forest regressors.
